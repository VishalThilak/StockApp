# Stock Web Application

## Description

A stock web application that uses machine learning to predict the forcast of a stock. The user simple selects
the stock of their choosing, and then they see a timeline of the stocks trend. 
In addition, I have created my own LSTM model attempting to predict the trend of a stock and seeing how accurate it is.
